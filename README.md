## 📖 Overview  
This project is a deep learning model for **Dog Breed Identification** based on images. The dataset comes from the Kaggle competition [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification), where the task is to classify images into 120 different dog breeds.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Pretrained CNN models (MobilenetV2)  
- Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- Transfer learning with fine-tuning    

## 📂 Dataset  
- 📥 Download: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)  
- **Training Data:** 10,222 labeled images of dogs (120 breeds)  
- **Test Data:** Unlabeled images for evaluation  
- **Format:** JPEG images + CSV with labels  

## ⚙️ Installation  
Open this notebook in google colab and mount the drive. Create a custom path in the googledrive `ML/dog-breed-identification/`

## 🏗 Model Training  
Create a folder `custom_images` and upload your images in the folder. Then, run the cells under the **Make predictions on custom images**
